Warning: game does not save, ever, so if the game crashed while playing, sorry, but it shouldn't.

It was originally intended to make the game a .exe file so you could run it easily,
but I haven't gotten around to doing that yet.

To launch the game, you will need to have python installed: https://www.python.org/downloads/
Python is the programming language I used to make the game

In the top right, click "Code" and then "Download Zip"

Extract these files and then open up the resulting folder

right click game.py and click "open with" and select python to play the game.
